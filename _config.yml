  Hello! I'm Jordi Solis – a Business Intelligence professional and transitioning academic advisor. 
 
 What fuels my work:
• Turning stakeholder questions into precise analytical frameworks
• Designing dashboards that make insights intuitive (not just "pretty")
• Balancing quantitative rigor with human context – because data without empathy is just noise

"Jordi has a strategic mind vital for initiatives and a natural empathy for people."
– Peter Marshall, Student Success Manager (Pearson)

Currently: Completed my Business Intelligence Certification (TripleTen, 2025) while driving enrollments at UMGC – where I recently exceeded expectations.
