 "BI Analyst | SQL + Tableau | Turning data into strategy"
  <br><br>
"Hello! I'm Jordi Solis â€“ a Business Intelligence professional with 7+ years in operational strategy and data-driven decision-making. As a former academic coach, I discovered that unlocking insights from data is even more rewarding than guiding students through complex curricula. Today, I bridge business needs and technical solutions by:

ðŸ”¹ Transforming raw data into actionable narratives using SQL, Tableau, and Power BI
ðŸ”¹ Optimizing processes (proven 15-25% efficiency gains in sales/retention)
ðŸ”¹ Mentoring peers in data literacy (30% avg. performance improvement)

My toolkit:
SQL | Tableau | Power BI | Salesforce | Process Documentation

What fuels my work:
â€¢ Turning stakeholder questions into precise analytical frameworks
â€¢ Designing dashboards that make insights intuitive (not just "pretty")
â€¢ Balancing quantitative rigor with human context â€“ because data without empathy is just noise

"Jordi has a strategic mind vital for initiatives and a natural empathy for people."
â€“ Peter Marshall, Student Success Manager (Pearson)

Currently: Completed my Business Intelligence Certification (TripleTen, 2025) while driving enrollment analytics at UMGC â€“ where I recently exceeded expectations.
